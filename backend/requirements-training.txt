# ============================================
# Training Requirements for Agri ROBO Tomato
# ============================================
# This file contains additional dependencies needed for MODEL TRAINING
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-training.txt
# 
# Note: Training should be done on a powerful machine (PC/laptop), 
# not on Raspberry Pi. The trained model can then be deployed to Pi.

# ============================================
# Include base backend requirements
# ============================================
-r requirements.txt

# ============================================
# Training-Specific Dependencies
# ============================================
# TensorFlow/Keras (already in base requirements, but ensure version)
tensorflow>=2.10.0,<3.0.0

# Data augmentation and preprocessing
# (included in tensorflow.keras.preprocessing)

# Model visualization (optional but recommended)
pydot>=1.4.2
graphviz>=0.20.0
# Note: graphviz requires system installation:
#   - Windows: Download from https://graphviz.org/download/
#   - Linux: sudo apt-get install graphviz
#   - macOS: brew install graphviz

# Progress bars and training monitoring (optional)
tqdm>=4.65.0

# ============================================
# Notes:
# ============================================
# - Training requires significant computational resources
# - GPU support recommended (CUDA-enabled TensorFlow)
# - Ensure sufficient disk space for model checkpoints
# - Training can take 1-3 hours depending on hardware
